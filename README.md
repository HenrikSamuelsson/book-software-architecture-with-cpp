## Assessments

There are assessment questions in the book, these are listed below along with my personal answers.

### Chapter 1

> Why should you care about software architecture?

A complete software architecture will ensure that all the requirements are meet. Especially non-functional requirements such as maintainability, security, and performance are at risk if not investing time in an software architecture.

The artifacts that is the output of software architectural work eases communication about the software with the various stakeholders. A customer might not be able to read the code but might still be able to understand the high level abstraction views part of the software architecture documentation.

An software architecture will impose implementation constraints which is a benefit because it prevents developers from making incorrect decisions but still enables the developers to do the implementation.

Software architecture will aid in preventing software decay over time by imposing a structure that developers can follow while maintaining the code base.

Proper but also not too extensive software architecture documentation makes it faster for new team member to get up to speed and be able to contribute to the project.
